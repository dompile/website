# DOMpile Starter Kit

Welcome to the **DOMpile Starter Kit**, a minimal scaffolding to get started building static sites with [DOMpile](https://npmjs.com/package/dompile).

DOMpile is a zero-boilerplate, convention-based static site generator that uses only standard HTML and a single `<include />` element to provide layouts, component includes, and scoped styles/scripts — all at build time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/dompile-starter my-site
cd my-site
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build your site

```bash
npm run build
```

The built site will appear in the `dist/` folder.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── components/

Happy hacking with ✨ **DOMpile** ✨
